# Database Normalization Best Practices

Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity. It involves organizing fields and tables to minimize duplication and dependency issues.

## Normalization Fundamentals

### First Normal Form (1NF)

- Each table cell should contain a single value
- Each record needs to be unique
- No repeating groups or arrays

**Example of violation:**
```
| OrderID | Products                      |
|---------|-------------------------------|
| 1001    | Keyboard, Mouse, Monitor      |
```

**Corrected (1NF):**
```
| OrderID | ProductID | Product  |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| 1001    | P1        | Keyboard |
| 1001    | P2        | Mouse    |
| 1001    | P3        | Monitor  |
```

### Second Normal Form (2NF)

- Must be in 1NF
- All non-key attributes must depend on the entire primary key

**Example of violation:**
```
| OrderID | ProductID | Product  | CustomerName |
|---------|-----------|----------|--------------|
| 1001    | P1        | Keyboard | John Doe     |
| 1001    | P2        | Mouse    | John Doe     |
```

**Corrected (2NF):**
```
// Orders table
| OrderID | CustomerName |
|---------|--------------|
| 1001    | John Doe     |

// OrderItems table
| OrderID | ProductID | Product  |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| 1001    | P1        | Keyboard |
| 1001    | P2        | Mouse    |
```

### Third Normal Form (3NF)

- Must be in 2NF
- No transitive dependencies (non-key attributes cannot depend on other non-key attributes)

**Example of violation:**
```
| OrderID | CustomerID | CustomerZip | CustomerCity |
|---------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| 1001    | C1         | 10001       | New York     |
```

**Corrected (3NF):**
```
// Orders table
| OrderID | CustomerID |
|---------|------------|
| 1001    | C1         |

// Customers table
| CustomerID | CustomerZip |
|------------|-------------|
| C1         | 10001       |

// ZipCodes table
| Zip   | City     |
|-------|----------|
| 10001 | New York |
```

### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)

- Must be in 3NF
- For any dependency A â†’ B, A must be a superkey

### Fourth Normal Form (4NF)

- Must be in BCNF
- No multi-valued dependencies

### Fifth Normal Form (5NF)

- Must be in 4NF
- No join dependencies

## Practical Normalization Guidelines

### When to Normalize

- When data integrity is critical
- When the database will undergo frequent updates
- When minimizing redundancy is important
- When the schema needs to be flexible for future changes

### When to Denormalize

- For read-heavy applications where performance is critical
- For reporting and analytics databases
- When the data is relatively static
- When joins would be too complex or expensive

## Normalization Techniques

### Identifying Functional Dependencies

1. Identify all attributes in your dataset
2. Determine which attributes functionally determine others
3. Identify candidate keys
4. Check for partial and transitive dependencies

### Decomposition

1. Start with a universal relation containing all attributes
2. Decompose into smaller relations based on functional dependencies
3. Ensure lossless join property
4. Verify dependency preservation

## Common Normalization Mistakes

- Over-normalization leading to excessive joins
- Under-normalization leading to data anomalies
- Incorrect identification of functional dependencies
- Ignoring business requirements in favor of strict normalization rules

## Balancing Normalization and Performance

### Selective Denormalization

- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Denormalize only specific tables or columns
- Consider materialized views for read-heavy operations
- Use calculated columns for frequently accessed derived data

### Indexing Normalized Tables

- Create appropriate indexes on join columns
- Index foreign keys
- Consider covering indexes for common queries
- Monitor and adjust indexes based on query patterns

## Normalization in Different Database Types

### Relational Databases

- Follow normalization rules strictly
- Use constraints to enforce relationships
- Leverage database features like views and stored procedures

### NoSQL Databases

- Denormalization is often preferred
- Embed related data when appropriate
- Use references for large or frequently changing data
- Design for specific query patterns

## Conclusion

Normalization is not an all-or-nothing approach. The appropriate level of normalization depends on your specific requirements, including:

- Data integrity needs
- Performance requirements
- Query patterns
- Update frequency
- Storage constraints

A well-designed database often uses a mix of normalized and denormalized structures to balance integrity and performance.
