# Database Normalization Best Practices

Normalization is a database design technique that reduces data redundancy and improves data integrity. This document outlines key normalization principles and best practices.

## What is Normalization?

Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity by dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them.

## Normalization Forms

### First Normal Form (1NF)
- Each table cell should contain a single value
- Each record needs to be unique
- No repeating groups or arrays
- Example violation: Storing multiple phone numbers in a single field

### Second Normal Form (2NF)
- Must be in 1NF
- All non-key attributes must depend on the entire primary key
- Remove partial dependencies
- Example: If a table has a composite key (A,B) and column C depends only on A, move C to a separate table with A as the key

### Third Normal Form (3NF)
- Must be in 2NF
- No transitive dependencies (non-key attributes shouldn't depend on other non-key attributes)
- Example: If address depends on city_id and city_name depends on city_id, city_name should be in a separate city table

### Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
- A stricter version of 3NF
- For any dependency A â†’ B, A should be a super key
- Addresses certain anomalies not handled by 3NF

### Fourth Normal Form (4NF)
- Must be in BCNF
- No multi-valued dependencies
- Useful when dealing with many-to-many relationships

### Fifth Normal Form (5NF)
- Deals with join dependencies
- Rarely implemented in practice due to complexity

## When to Normalize

- When data integrity is critical
- When the database will undergo frequent updates
- When minimizing redundancy is important
- When the database schema needs to be flexible for future changes

## When to Denormalize

Denormalization is the process of adding redundant data to improve read performance.

Consider denormalization when:
- Read performance is more critical than write performance
- Queries frequently join many tables
- The application is read-heavy
- The data is relatively static (not frequently updated)

## Practical Normalization Tips

1. **Start with 3NF**: Aim for at least Third Normal Form in most applications
2. **Balance with performance**: Consider strategic denormalization for performance-critical operations
3. **Use junction tables**: For many-to-many relationships
4. **Consider data access patterns**: Design with common query patterns in mind
5. **Document decisions**: Clearly document where and why you've chosen to denormalize

## Common Normalization Mistakes

- Over-normalization leading to excessive joins and poor performance
- Under-normalization leading to data anomalies and redundancy
- Ignoring real-world query patterns when designing the schema
- Not considering the impact of normalization on application code
