  "input": "Create the database schema.\n\n**Perform conceptual data modeling for a procurement system in an electronics contract manufacturing company.**\n\nCompany A is an electronics contract manufacturer that mounts electronic components onto circuit boards. It receives orders from clients—who develop products such as automobiles and home appliances—to manufacture prototypes of electronic devices, and it handles both component procurement and prototype production. This time, the conceptual data model and the relational schema of the procurement system have been redesigned.\n\n---\n\n**[Current Operations]**\n\n### 1. Organization\n\n1. Each organization is identified by an organization code and has an organization name. Organization names are unique.\n2. Organizations have a hierarchical structure, and each belongs to exactly one parent organization.\n\n### 2. Position\n\nEach position is identified by a position code and has a position name. Position names are unique.\n\n### 3. Employee\n\n1. Each employee is identified by an employee code and has a name. Employees may share the same name.\n2. Each employee belongs to one or more organizations.\n3. Some employees are assigned a position in each organization they belong to. An employee does not hold multiple positions within the same organization.\n4. For each organization an employee belongs to, there is at most one designated reporting employee.\n\n### 4. Clients and Suppliers\n\n1. The ordering parties for contract manufacturing are called \"clients\", and the vendors of electronic components are called \"suppliers\".\n2. Clients and suppliers are collectively referred to as \"business partners\". A business partner is identified by a business partner code and has a name and address.\n3. Whether a business partner is a client or a supplier is distinguished by a business partner category. No business partner is both a client and a supplier.\n4. Suppliers are trading companies that handle electronic components. Company A negotiates procurement conditions (unit price, lot size, deliverable date) with suppliers. Each supplier has a total procurement amount from the previous fiscal year.\n5. Clients have a total order amount from the previous fiscal year.\n\n### 5. Item\n\n1. Electronic components used in prototypes are called “items” and are manufactured by electronic component manufacturers (hereafter, \"manufacturers\").\n\n   * Each item is identified by a manufacturer part number assigned by the manufacturer. Manufacturer part numbers are unique across manufacturers.\n   * Manufacturer part numbers listed in electronic component catalogs describe specifications and electrical characteristics but do not include unit price or lot size.\n2. Each item belongs to one brand assigned by the manufacturer.\n\n   * A brand is identified by a brand code and has a brand name.\n   * Suppliers may handle multiple brands, and the same brand can be sourced from multiple suppliers. Each supplier registers which brands they handle.\n3. Each item belongs to a single item category, which is a group of items.\n\n   * Item categories are identified by item category codes and have item category names.\n\n### 6. Prototype Project Registration\n\n1. A prototype refers to the preparation of multiple models with different performance and functions for the purpose of design validation and functionality comparison before mass production. Clients provide design drawings, item compositions, and quantities for each model, and Company A registers the following information as a prototype project:\n\n   * **Prototype Project**\n\n     * Identified by a prototype project number and has a name, client, product purpose, and registration date.\n   * **Model**\n\n     * Each model has a name, design drawing number, production quantity, and requested delivery date from the client. Identified by the prototype project number and model name.\n   * **Model Item Composition**\n\n     * For each item used in a model, the required quantity per unit is recorded.\n   * **Prototype Project Item**\n\n     * For each item used in the prototype project, the total required quantity is recorded.\n     * Although Company A usually procures the items, some items are provided free of charge by the client. The quantity of such items is recorded as the client-provided quantity.\n     * The actual required procurement quantity is the total required quantity minus the client-provided quantity.\n\n### 7. From Request for Quotation to Receipt of Quotation\n\n1. When procuring items, Company A sends RFQs (Requests for Quotation) to multiple suppliers that handle the brand of the item.\n\n   * Each RFQ is given a request number and the request date is recorded. It must be linked to the corresponding prototype project.\n   * The client’s name cannot be disclosed to suppliers, but to get advice from suppliers in case the client selects an inappropriate item, the product purpose is shared.\n   * Each item in the RFQ is assigned an RFQ detail number, along with the required quantity and desired delivery date.\n   * Suppliers are requested to include the RFQ number and RFQ detail number in their quotation responses.\n2. Quotations are received from suppliers. A single quotation is expected per RFQ.\n\n   * Each quotation includes the RFQ number, validity period, quotation date, and a supplier-issued quotation number (which may not be unique across suppliers).\n   * Each quotation detail includes the RFQ detail number, manufacturer part number, procurement conditions, and a supplier-issued quotation detail number (which may not be unique across suppliers). Some items may not receive a quotation.\n   * A quotation detail may propose different items than those requested. In such cases, the reason for the proposal is recorded.\n   * A single item may have multiple procurement conditions in a quotation detail. For example, if the required quantity is 300 units and the lot size is 1,000, the supplier may quote:\n\n     * ¥0.5 per unit for a lot size of 1,000 units\n     * ¥2 per unit for a lot size of 1 unit\n\n### 8. From Purchase Order to Receiving\n\n1. After consulting with the client and reviewing the quotations, one appropriate procurement condition is selected for each item.\n\n   * The selected quotation detail is recorded in the purchase order detail, along with the number of lots to order and the specified delivery date.\n   * Order details issued to the same supplier around the same time are grouped into a single purchase order, even across different prototype projects.\n   * Each purchase order is assigned a purchase order number, along with the order date and total order amount.\n2. Items are received from suppliers based on the purchase order.\n\n   * Each receipt is assigned a receipt number and the receipt date is recorded.\n   * Each item received is assigned a receipt detail number. A purchase order detail corresponds to a single receipt (no split deliveries).\n   * A label with the receipt number and detail number is attached to the item packaging and handed over to the production team.\n\n"
