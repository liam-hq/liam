## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- [#2421](https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/pull/2421) - - ‚ú®Ô∏è Fix composite primary key and unique constraint handling in PostgreSQL and tbls parsers / Thanks [@hoshinotsuyoshi](https://github.com/hoshinotsuyoshi)!
  - **Change**: PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE constraints now use `columnNames: string[]` instead of `columnName: string`
  - **PostgreSQL parser**: Fixed bug where composite primary keys were incorrectly split into separate constraints (Issue #2260)
  - **tbls parser**: Fixed handling of composite constraints to use array format
  - **UI improvements**: Constraint details now display multiple columns as comma-separated values
  - **Known limitation**: Diff detection currently only checks the first column in composite constraints (TODO added)
  - This change ensures composite primary keys like `PRIMARY KEY (user_id, role_id)` are correctly represented as a single constraint with multiple columns, rather than being split into separate constraints.
