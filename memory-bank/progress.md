# Progress

## What Works
- AI components have been successfully integrated to analyze migration impacts and provide intelligent suggestions.
- The product is deployed in the AWS us-east-1 region, supporting English-speaking markets.
- The GitHub App integration is operational, automating comments and review approvals on PRs.
- Complete review pipeline from GitHub webhook to AI review generation to PR comment posting.
- Modular architecture with separate functions for review generation and comment posting.

## What's Left to Build
- Enhanced schema change detection to better identify and analyze database migrations.
- Improved review prompt template for more detailed and contextual analysis.
- Further refinement of AI components to enhance the accuracy and relevance of suggestions.
- Development of Builder User features, planned for later phases, leveraging accumulated review data and feedback.
- Exploration of multi-region deployment opportunities as user needs grow.

## Current Status
The project is currently focused on enhancing the Reviewer User experience, with AI-driven analysis and suggestions integrated into the migration review process. The initial release prioritizes the Reviewer User, with Builder User features planned for future phases.

The core review pipeline is now operational, connecting GitHub webhooks to AI-powered review generation and PR comment posting. This enables automatic review of database schema changes when pull requests are opened or updated.

## Known Issues
- The schema change detection is basic and needs enhancement to better identify relevant migration files.
- The review prompt template is simple and could be improved to provide more detailed analysis.
- Continuous learning for AI components is required to improve accuracy and relevance over time.
- The coexistence with the OSS version needs to be managed carefully to ensure a sustainable business model.
